# cumanaws

## Domains and Web Hosting Control Panel.

**cumanaws** is a Ruby on Rails 4 based, Domains and Web Hosting Control Panel. Or that is what we want it to be.

Is still a child and there are a lot of missing features for now.

## Goals:

**Must be completely open source**

**Must be easy to use for anyone (providers and costumers).**

**It will provide a full-featured platform that it will work with the following services:**

Web server:

* Apache2 HTTP/HTTPS Server

App servers:

* Unicorn (for Ruby and Python)
* PHP5-FPM (for PHP5)
* NodeJS

Database servers:

* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* SQLite
* MongoDB

E-Mail server:

* Postfix
* Dovecot

DNS Server:

* Bind9

FTP Server:

* PureFTPd

**Also it will be integrated with the following applications:**

* Roundcube (web-based email client)
* ownCloud (online data storage and synchronization)
